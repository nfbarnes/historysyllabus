### Instructor: Rachel, Lauren, & PS

## Course Description (What This Is)

In this course, we’ll explore queer themes in digital media. We’ll draw from queer theory, such as | EXAMPLES |, and from queer artists and designers. We’ll also create our own media content that explores queer themes of subversion, | challenging heteronormativity, THEME 3 |—culminating in a portfolio of your own work. What makes media “queer” in the first place? | MORE QUESTIONS |. This course should appeal to students who are interested in media or film studies, professional and collaborative media environments, and multimedia creative design. To support these themes, this course is broken into three units:

- **Queer Remix**: Together, we’ll explore how artists, designers, and makers actively ‘queer’ established content: remixing it to give it new (and subversive) meaning. We’ll talk about queerbaiting, ships, canons and ‘fanons.’ At the end of this unit, you’ll perform a remix of your own!
- **Queer Narratives**: We will be exploring queer narratives in popular media like film, television, and video games. Through these media texts, we will engage with queer theoretical concepts such as queer representation in media, compulsive heterosexuality, and the homo/heterosexual binary. At the end of the unit, you'll have the opportunity to create your own queer script or film. 
- **Queer Activism**: In this unit, we'll be following the role that activists have played in creating a more equitable future for LGBTQIA+ and queer people in the United States. You'll also be examining the artifacts left behind by these activists, relating them to current queer equality movements, and creating artifacts for  queer activists and movements from around the world. 
  
At the end of each unit, you’ll submit a small project of your own media content. These will all culminate in a final unit, where we’ll work on curating our work into a Reflective Portfolio. Each week, we’ll complete three kinds of tasks to get us there:

- **Explores**: In Explores, we'll read a thing each week. Usually, this will be theory or research: helping guide our understanding and practice.
- **Encounters**: In Encounters, we’ll play/watch/read/engage queer media content in-action and try out some of the strategies and practices ourselves.
- **Creates**: In Creates, you'll share your thoughts as we go, and share pieces of your larger projects in-action.

## Student Learning Outcomes (What We'll Learn)

This course develops a better understanding of artistic expression and creative processes through historical and cultural content, theory, and critical design. By the end of this course, we will...

- **Get Crafty**: We'll embrace our inner swamp witches and experiment with strategies of invention and subversion at the root of the creative process.
- **Stick Together**: We’ll work together in a project-oriented environment, learning essential cooperation in a creative environment.
- **Get Out There**: We'll discover contemporary queer media culture and explore ways of encountering the world as a media artist/designer.
- **Save (or Burn Down) The World**: We'll explore genres and forms of media and the way these intersect, diverge, and require transgression.
- **Make Our Own Monsters**: We'll produce creative works of our own inspired by a range of prompts, models, media, and provocations.
- **Prove Ourselves**: We’ll produce our own, original, portfolios that  demonstrate our creative prowess.

## Course Materials and Texts (What You'll Need)

Many of the texts for this course will be provided for you through our course site. This will predominantly mean following links, but there will also be PDFs, games, videos, and other materials that you will be viewing.

You will need *regular access to a computer or laptop* for this class. You will also need consistent internet access for readings, class materials, etc. If you have trouble getting ahold to any of these materials, or are unable to use a computer for an extended period of time for any reason, please feel free to reach out to me, and I can help get you connected with campus technology resources or work with you to develop an alternative.

## Evaluation and Grading (How This Works)

This class uses a point-based grading system that is seperate from its system for feedback. This is so that you can comfortably experiment with strategies and ideas in a risk-free environment.

What this means is **as long as you complete the basic requirements laid out for each assignment, you will receive the full points possible.** However, I will be providing you detailed qualitative feedback on your analyses and your projects based on the goals that you communicate in your proposals. This feedback, however, will not result in lost points.

Otherwise, points will be used to determine your final grade according to the following:

| Assignment | Point Value |
|-|-|
| Creates (12 total, 2.5 Points Each) | 25 (30 possible) |
| Remix Project | 5 Points |
| Narrative Project | 10 Points |
| Activism Project | 10 Points |
| Final Reflective Portfolio | 50 Points |
| **TOTAL** | **100 Points** |

Note that you are only expected to *complete 10 of the twelve* Creates, though you can complete all of them for extra credit.

**Remix Project:** [PS]

**Narrative Project:** You will create either a brief script for a short film, or shoot your own video, that tells an original story with queer characters or themes. This narrative should both be personally impactful to you and should engage with the ideas and issues surrounding queer representation in media that we explored in the unit.  

**Activism Project:** [Lauren]

The **Final Reflective Portfolio** will include revisions of your other projects, as well as a critical reflection. This reflection can either be theoretical (a theory about Queer Media) or artistic (exploring your own position or growth as a media artist and designer).

Late work is accepted as long as it submitted within 1 week of the original deadline, or with instructor approval. Any extensions that have been asked for **24 hours** ahead of the deadline of a project or assignment will be granted. The Final Reflective Portfolio, however, must be submitted on time.

### Collaboration (We're In this Together)

> “I want my group mates to attend my funeral, so that they can let me down one last time.”

This class will involve a significant amount of group-work (and group-play!) as the semester unfolds. You will be sharing your work, ideas, projects, gossip, etc.—and learning to work in a community is a crucial part of the media world. For this class, you and several other students will be grouped into teams. Each of you will have a role in this team, and you’ll often work on assignments, projects, and workshops together.

In the event of any, ah, *DRAMA* amongst team members, let me know about the *DRAMA*, and I will sit y’all down for a A Completely Nonthreatening Resolution Meeting™. During our Completely Nonthreatening Resolution Meeting™ and we will write up a Group Contract together that clarifies expectations amongst group members (and specifies consequences). This will be decided by the team members, and then signed into syllabus law. I will then enforce the contract your team has established.

## Course Policies

### UCF’s Course Accessibility Statement

The University of Central Florida is committed to providing access and inclusion for all persons with disabilities. This syllabus is available in alternate formats upon request. Students with disabilities who need specific access in this course, such as accommodations, should contact the professor as soon as possible to discuss various access options. Students may also connect with Student Accessibility Services (Ferrell Commons, 7F, Room 185, sas@ucf.edu, phone (407) 823-2371). Through Student Accessibility Services, a Course Accessibility Letter may be created and sent to professors, which informs faculty of potential access and accommodations. 

**My Inclusive Learning Statement**

No two people learn exactly the same way. If you find that the materials are difficult for you to absorb, don’t assume right away that you don’t understand the material! Perhaps you prefer to process information through speaking or listening, but all I am providing are written handouts, making it difficult for you to process. If there are aspects of the design, instruction, and/or experiences within this course that result in barriers to your inclusion or accurate assessment of achievement, please notify me as soon as possible.

Disabilities are visible and invisible, documented and undocumented: I do not distinguish between these designations. If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, I encourage you to speak with me as soon as you can about your learning needs and how I can best accommodate them, and/or contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS) [see contact information above].

I do not require documentation for accessibility in my classroom. If you have learning needs from me that I'm not meeting, you can come tell me. You may contact SAS without notifying me if you wish; you may also speak with me without contacting SAS at all.


### Academic Integrity

Students should familiarize themselves with UCF’s Rules of Conduct at <https://scai.sdes.ucf.edu/student-rules-of-conduct/>. According to Section 1, “Academic Misconduct,” students are prohibited from engaging in

1. Unauthorized assistance: Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information or study aids in any academic exercise unless specifically authorized by the instructor of record. The unauthorized possession of examination or course-related material also constitutes cheating.
2. Communication to another through written, visual, electronic, or oral means: The presentation of material which has not been studied or learned, but rather was obtained through someone else’s efforts and used as part of an examination, course assignment, or project.
3. Commercial Use of Academic Material: Selling of course material to another person, student, and/or uploading course material to a third-party vendor without authorization or without the express written permission of the university and the instructor. Course materials include but are not limited to class notes, Instructor’s PowerPoints, course syllabi, tests, quizzes, labs, instruction sheets, homework, study guides, handouts, etc.
4. Falsifying or misrepresenting the student’s own academic work.
5. Plagiarism: Using or appropriating another’s work without any indication of the source, thereby attempting to convey the impression that such work is the student’s own.
6. Multiple Submissions: Submitting the same academic work for credit more than once without the express written permission of the instructor.
7. Helping another violate academic behavior standards.
8. Soliciting assistance with academic coursework and/or degree requirements.

#### Responses to Academic Dishonesty, Plagiarism, or Cheating

Students should also familiarize themselves with the procedures for academic misconduct in UCF’s student handbook, The Golden Rule <https://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/>. UCF faculty members have a responsibility for students’ education and the value of a UCF degree, and so seek to prevent unethical behavior and respond to academic misconduct when necessary. Penalties for violating rules, policies, and instructions within this course can range from a zero on the exercise to an “F” letter grade in the course. In addition, an Academic Misconduct report could be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which could lead to disciplinary warning, disciplinary probation, or deferred suspension or separation from the University through suspension, dismissal, or expulsion with the addition of a “Z” designation on one’s transcript.

Being found in violation of academic conduct standards could result in a student having to disclose such behavior on a graduate school application, being removed from a leadership position within a student organization, the recipient of scholarships, participation in University activities such as study abroad, internships, etc.

Let’s avoid all of this by demonstrating values of honesty, trust, and integrity. No grade is worth compromising your integrity and moving your moral compass. Stay true to doing the right thing: take the zero, not a shortcut.

### Statement on Harassment and Discrimination

I will not allow any form of harassment, or discrimination based on race, religion, gender identity, pronouns, sexual orientation, ability, etc. in any course assignments, discussions, or messages. If you or a classmate is experiencing harassment or discrimination in any form from another student or university employee, please reach out to me and I will provide any assistance that I can. For UCF’s policies on harassment and discrimination, see the Let's Be Clear website.

### Land Acknowledgement

We acknowledge, with respect, that the land we are on today is the traditional and ancestral homelands of the Seminole, Miccosukee, Timucua, and numerous other Native tribes. We also acknowledge the manipulation, coercion, and violence enacted against these nations, including the Treaties of Moultrie Creek, Payne’s Landing, and Pensacola, which now afford us access to the land, water, and air of these Nations’ traditional homelands. We recognize the violent past and dire, ongoing costs to Native Nations and peoples on whose land this university -- now a place of learning and socialization -- was built upon. We recognize the Indigenous peoples as original stewards of this land and all the relatives within it.

We understand that acknolwedgement is not enough and that we, as a course community, as a department, and as an institution, should actively work towards decolonization and the return of Native lands to Native peoples. This acknowledgement acts as a conversation starter, one that needs to be had in this country where so many Native lives have been lost to a inhospitable government and its people, and that only through action, and not just words in fancy statements, will we be able to truly honor the Native people and their land. 

### Course Accessibility Statement

The University of Central Florida is committed to providing access and inclusion for all persons with disabilities. Students with disabilities who need access to course content due to course design limitations should contact the professor as soon as possible. Students should also connect with Student Accessibility Services (SAS) <http://sas.sdes.ucf.edu/> (Ferrell Commons 185, sas@ucf.edu, phone 407-823-2371). For students connected with SAS, a Course Accessibility Letter may be created and sent to professors, which informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Determining reasonable access and accommodations requires consideration of the course design, course learning objectives and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SAS, faculty and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience.

### Campus Safety Statement

Emergencies on campus are rare, but if one should arise during class, everyone needs to work together. Students should be aware of their surroundings and familiar with some basic safety and security concepts.

- In case of an emergency, dial 911 for assistance.
- Every UCF classroom contains an emergency procedure guide posted on a wall near the door. Students should make a note of the guide’s physical location and review the online version at <http://emergency.ucf.edu/emergency_guide.html>.
Students should know the evacuation routes from each of their classrooms and have a plan for finding safety in case of an emergency.
- If there is a medical emergency during class, students may need to access a first-aid kit or AED (Automated External Defibrillator). To learn where those are located, see <https://ehs.ucf.edu/automated-external-defibrillator-aed-locations>.
- To stay informed about emergency situations, students can sign up to receive UCF text alerts by going to <https://my.ucf.edu> and logging in. Click on “Student Self Service” located on the left side of the screen in the toolbar, scroll down to the blue “Personal Information” heading on the Student Center screen, click on “UCF Alert”, fill out the information, including e-mail address, cell phone number, and cell phone provider, click “Apply” to save the changes, and then click “OK.”
- Students with special needs related to emergency situations should speak with their instructors outside of class.
- To learn about how to manage an active-shooter situation on campus or elsewhere, consider viewing this video (<https://youtu.be/NIKYajEx4pk>).

#### Campus Safety Statement for Students in Online-Only Courses

Though most emergency situations are primarily relevant to courses that meet in person, such incidents can also impact online students, either when they are on or near campus to participate in other courses or activities or when their course work is affected by off-campus emergencies. The following policies apply to courses in online modalities.

- To stay informed about emergency situations, students can sign up to receive UCF text alerts by going to <https://my.ucf.edu> and logging in. Click on “Student Self Service” located on the left side of the screen in the toolbar, scroll down to the blue “Personal Information” heading on the Student Center screen, click on “UCF Alert”, fill out the information, including e-mail address, cell phone number, and cell phone provider, click “Apply” to save the changes, and then click “OK.”
- Students with special needs related to emergency situations should speak with their instructors outside of class.

**Deployed Active Military Students:** Students who are deployed active duty military and/or National Guard personnel and require accommodation should contact their instructors as soon as possible after the semester begins and/or after they receive notification of deployment to make related arrangements.

**Make-Up Assignments for Authorized University Events or Co-curricular Activities:** Students who represent the university in an authorized event or activity (for example, student-athletes) and who are unable to meet a course deadline due to a conflict with that event must provide the instructor with documentation in advance to arrange a make-up. No penalty will be applied. For more information, see the UCF policy at <https://policies.ucf.edu/documents/4-401.pdf>

**Religious Observances**: Students must notify their instructor in advance if they intend to miss class for a religious observance. For more information, see the UCF policy at <http://regulations.ucf.edu/chapter5/documents/5.020ReligiousObservancesFINALJan19.pdf>.

**University-Wide Face Covering Policy for Common Spaces and Face-to-Face Classes**: To protect members of our community, everyone is required to wear a facial covering inside all common spaces including classrooms <https://policies.ucf.edu/documents/PolicyEmergencyCOVIDReturnPolicy.pdf>. Students who choose not to wear facial coverings will be asked to leave the classroom by the instructor. If they refuse to leave the classroom or put on a facial covering, they may be considered disruptive (please see the Golden Rule for student behavior expectations). Faculty have the right to cancel class if the safety and well-being of class members are in jeopardy. Students will be responsible for the material that would have been covered in class as provided by the instructor.

**Notifications in Case of Changes to Course Modality**: Depending on the course of the pandemic during the semester, the university may make changes to the way classes are offered. If that happens, please look for announcements or messages in Webcourses@UCF or Knights email about changes specific to this course.

**COVID-19 and Illness Notification**: Students who believe they may have a COVID-19 diagnosis should contact UCF Student Health Services (407-823-2509) so proper contact tracing procedures can take place.

Students should not come to campus if they are ill, are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19, have tested positive for COVID, or if anyone living in their residence has tested positive or is sick with COVID-19 symptoms. CDC guidance for COVID-19 symptoms is located here: <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html>

Students should contact their instructor(s) as soon as possible if they miss class for any illness reason to discuss reasonable adjustments that might need to be made. When possible, students should contact their instructor(s) before missing class.

**In Case of Faculty Illness**: If the instructor falls ill during the semester, there may be changes to this course, including having a backup instructor take over the course. Please look for announcements or mail in Webcourses@UCF or Knights email for any alterations to this course.

**Course Accessibility and Disability COVID-19 Supplemental Statement**: Accommodations may need to be added or adjusted should this course shift from an on-campus to a remote format. Students with disabilities should speak with their instructor and should contact sas@ucf.edu to discuss specific accommodations for this or other courses.
