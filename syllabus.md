## 1.1. Course Description (What This Is)

In this course, we’ll explore queer themes in digital media. We’ll draw from queer theory, and from queer artists and designers. We’ll also create our own media content that explores queer themes of subversion, challenging heteronormativity, activism and remix—culminating in a portfolio of your own work. What makes media “queer” in the first place? How have queer communities built and used artistic and theoretical frameworks for their media? How are people actively 'queering' traditionally restrictive or harmful media? This course should appeal to students who are interested in media or film studies, professional and collaborative media environments, and multimedia creative design. To support these themes, this course is broken into three units:

- **Queer Remix**: Together, we’ll explore how artists, designers, and makers actively ‘queer’ established content: remixing it to give it new (and subversive) meaning. We’ll talk about queerbaiting, ships, canons and ‘fanons.’ At the end of this unit, you’ll perform a remix of your own!
- **Queer Narratives**: We will be exploring queer narratives in popular media like film, television, and video games. Through these media texts, we will engage with queer theoretical concepts such as queer representation in media, compulsive heterosexuality, and the homo/heterosexual binary. At the end of the unit, you'll have the opportunity to create your own queer script or film.
- **Queer Activism**: In this unit, we'll be following the role that activists have played in creating a more equitable future for LGBTQIA+ and queer people in the United States. You'll also be examining the artifacts left behind by these activists, relating them to current queer equality movements, and creating artifacts for  queer activists and movements from around the world.
  
At the end of each unit, you’ll submit a small project of your own media content. These will all culminate in a final unit, where we’ll work on curating our work into a Reflective Portfolio. Each week, we’ll complete three kinds of tasks to get us there:

- **Explores**: In Explores, we'll read a thing each week. Usually, this will be theory or research: helping guide our understanding and practice.
- **Encounters**: In Encounters, we’ll play/watch/read/engage queer media content in-action and try out some of the strategies and practices ourselves.
- **Creates**: In Creates, you'll share your thoughts as we go, and share pieces of your larger projects in-action.

## 1.2. Student Learning Outcomes (What We'll Learn)

This course develops a better understanding of artistic expression and creative processes through historical and cultural content, theory, and critical design. By the end of this course, we will...

- **Get Crafty**: We'll embrace our inner swamp witches and experiment with strategies of invention and subversion at the root of the creative process.
- **Stick Together**: We’ll work together in a project-oriented environment, learning essential cooperation in a creative environment.
- **Get Out There**: We'll discover contemporary queer media culture and explore ways of encountering the world as a media artist/designer.
- **Save (or Burn Down) The World**: We'll explore genres and forms of media and the way these intersect, diverge, and require transgression.
- **Make Our Own Monsters**: We'll produce creative works of our own inspired by a range of prompts, models, media, and provocations.
- **Prove Ourselves**: We’ll produce our own, original, portfolios that  demonstrate our creative prowess.

## 1.3. Course Materials and Texts (What You'll Need)

Many of the texts for this course will be provided for you through our course site. This will predominantly mean following links, but there will also be PDFs, games, videos, and other materials that you will be viewing.

You will need *regular access to a computer or laptop* for this class. You will also need consistent internet access for readings, class materials, etc. If you have trouble getting ahold to any of these materials, or are unable to use a computer for an extended period of time for any reason, please feel free to reach out to me, and I can help get you connected with campus technology resources or work with you to develop an alternative.

## 1.4. Course Outline (What We're Getting Up To)

| Week | This week, we're tackling... | Explore (Due Classtime Tuesday) | Encounter (Due Classtime Thurdsay) | Create (Due 11:59pm Sunday) |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Week 1 | Syllabus, Ground "Rules," What Is "Queer Media"? | None for today. Welcome to class! | Check out the syllabus! :) | Introduce yourself on the class forum. |
| Week 2 | Teamwork, Mashups, Subversion 101. | Read Eve Sedgewick's "Introduction: Axiomatic" from *Epistemology of the Closet* | Watch [Paris is Burning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LUH8sRwzBs) <br/> Watch Season 1 Episode 1 of Pose (available on Netflix) | **Discuss:** **LAUREN, help, I haven't seen these, can you put a discussion question or two here pls!** </br>**Create:** Connect with your new team members. You'll be working together over the course of the semester to collaborate and share your work. For now, come up with a team name, and post it and your mashup-image below! |
|  |  | UNIT 1: QUEER REMIX |  |  |
| Week 3 | Queer Interpretations, Erasure | Read Bo Ruberg's "'Loving Father, Caring Husband, Secret Octopus' - Queer Embodiment and Passing in Octodad" | Read selections from Chase Berggrun's RED (PDF) (Chapters I-III and XII-XIX) (Don't worry, they're very short). | **Discuss**: Both works for this week engage thinking about 'queer readings' of works that aren't expressly queer or may have even contain homophophobic and transphobic themes. Ruberg challenges us by performing a queer reading on a surprising subject, Octodad. And Chase Berggrun performs an erasure in order to build new layers of personal meaning onto a classic text. In a short post, share your thoughts about how these works challenge/change/re(f)use the meanings of the original. Where have you seen these kinds of ‘reimaginings’ before? If you happen to be familiar with either source, what do you think about Ruberg or Berggrun’s response? If you’re not familiar, how do you see them making it their own? </br>**Create**: This week, you’ll be performing an erasure of your own, our first foray into ‘remix.’ The source of the original text can be anything (though you may find it easier if you can copy the words directly—although editing a photo is perfectly fine, and sometimes more powerful). You might look at: birth certificates, leasing documents, postcards, webpages, news articles, text messages, social media profiles. Copy out words (whole words or parts of them) and—keeping them in order—write something that gives it new meaning. If you are working with images, use our Photo Editing Toolkit to help you. In the end, you decide how much you want it to relate to its source material but do tell us what the source for your erasure was. |
| Week 4 | Queerbaiting & Reclaiming, Working with Images | Read "Between text, paratext, and context: Queerbaiting and the contemporary media landscape" in Transformative Works and Culture | Read "Queer video remix and LGBTQ online communities in" Transformative Works and Culture | **Discuss**: This week, we’ll be thinking about our own remix projects. We’ve looked at queerbaiting, and examples of remix, but in the next two weeks we’ll turn to thinking about how we want to ‘hack’ media narratives ourselves.  After reading the remix project assignment sheet, share a brief proposal for your media project. It’s okay if it’s a little open ended at this stage, but be sure to consider: 1) What you want to use as a source for your project. It can be a single source that you’re cutting/dubbing/altering, or it can be a mashup. 2) What ideas are you hoping to challenge/illuminate/transgress/repurpose from the source? 3) What do you want to express through this remix?   </br>**Create**: Using our video toolkit, and the tricks we’ve learned in class, submit your own Video Haiku project. This video should be no more than 30 seconds long, and can either include: 1) a video with new audio dubbed over it. 2) A cut between two separate clips. 3) A short mashup of visual clips over music. Once you’re done, upload your Haiku with a title, and 1-sentence description below. |
| Week 5 | Hacking Structures, Breaking Rules, Working with Audio/Video | Read "Queer Gaming: Gaming, Hacking, and Going Turbo" by Jack Halberstam from Queer Game Studies (PDF) | Play Porpentine Charity Heartscape's games "Foldscape" <https://porpentine.itch.io/foldscape> and at any one of her other games: <http://slimedaughter.com/games/>. | **Discuss**: This week, we’ve looked at how queer media often subverts conventional structures. With this in mind, think about what kind of structures you’re working with in your Remix project. What kind of expectations will your audience have, given the form? Which of these expectations do you want to break deliberately, and why? Share in a short post how you plan to engage / subvert these structures. </br>**Create**: Share an update of your Remix Project so far. You might include a screenshot, a short snippet, a storyboard, a clip or two, art-in-progress, whatever you have at this point, as well as one or two questions that you’re thinking about moving forward. |
| Week 6 | Remix Project Week! | Bring to class one example of a "reclaiming": Fiction, art, image, video, hashtags—something that remakes the original in a subversive way. | Bring to class a working prototype of your Remix Project to share with your teams. | REMIX PROJECT DUE BY 11:59PM! Good luck!  |
|  |  | UNIT 2: QUEER NARRATIVES |  |  |
| Week 7 | Queer Video Games: the Importance of Queer Representation| Read "Putting the Gay in Games: Cultural Production and GLBT Content in Video Games" by Adrienne Shaw | Play The Fullbright Company's *Gone Home* (available on Steam) | **Discuss:** Critically engage Gone Home’s depiction of a queer narrative by connecting your  impressions of the game with Shaw’s critique of GLBT representation in video games. <br/> **Create:** Select, briefly describe, and analyze your own example of queer representation in popular media (TV, film, or video games). How does the text represent its queer characters, and what are the some affordances and/or drawbacks of how that queer narrative is presented? |
| Week 8 | Queer Film: Heteronormativity, Masculinity, and Race | Read C.J. Pascoe's *Dude You're a Fag: Masculinity and Sexuality in High School* Chapter 4 (PDF) | Watch Barry Jenkins' *Moonlight* (currently available on Netflix) | **Discuss:** How does Pascoe’s concept of “compulsive heterosexuality” apply to Chiron’s story in Moonlight? What aspects of Chiron’s identity (race, gender, sexuality) are impacted by his adolescent upbringing, and the expectations of masculinity in his community? <br/> **Create:** Submit a short description of the story for your queer film script or short film, including which format you will choose and what impact you hope your film will make. |
| Week 9 | Queer Television: Pan/Bisexuality and the Homo/Heterosexual Binary | Read Maria San Filippo's *The B Word* Epilogue and Introduction | Watch Schitt's Creek Season 1 Episode 10 "Honeymoon" and Season 5 Episode 11 "Meet the Parents" (currently available on Netflix) | **Discuss:** In what ways does David’s pansexual identity in Schitt’s Creek “subvert, or ‘unthink’ monosexuality” (San Filippo 18)? In what ways might Patrick’s reluctance to come out be reflective of the monosexual and heterosexual assumptions that San Filippo discusses? <br/> **Create:** Share the first scene of your short film script or footage, and give us a "check-in" on your progress |
| Week 10 | Queer Short Film Project Week! | Watch the short film "Listen" available on Vimeo | Bring a rough draft of your script or an early edit of your film | **Create:** Either write a brief script for a short film, or shoot your own video, that tells an original story with queer characters or themes. This narrative should both be personally impactful to you and should engage with the ideas and issues surrounding queer representation in media that we explored in the unit.  **Queer Narrative Project due by 11:59 PM**. You've got this! |
|  |  | UNIT 3: QUEER ACTIVISM |  |  |
| Week 11 | Beyond the Hetero/Homosexual Binary | Read ["Punks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics?"](https://doi.org/10.1215/10642684-3-4-437) by Cathy J. Cohen and "Captialism and Gay Identity" by John D'Emilio | Watch *Pride* (2014 film); available on Amazon Prime or YouTube | **Discuss**: Research a queer activist (doesn't have to be a US activist or within the last 100 years). Why did you choose them? What is inspirational about their activism? How has their work persisted to today's queer activism? <br> **Create**: Make a small bio for the activist (like one you might find on a professional website). </br> |
| Week 12 | The AIDS Epidemic | Read "Critical Investments: AIDS, Christopher Reeve, and Queer/Disability Studies" by Robert McRuer and "Portraits of People with AIDS" from *Melancholia and Moralism: Essays on AIDS and Queer Politics* by Douglas Crimp | Watch *How to Survive a Plague* (2014 film); available on Amazon and view the [Interactive AIDS Quilt](https://www.aidsmemorial.org/interactive-aids-quilt) | **Discuss**: Consider the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic and AIDS were covered by the media; how were these two epidemics treated similarly/differently?  Think about the similarlities and differences in how each has affect the queer community. Then, think about the artifacts that we have left over from the AIDS epidemic; how might the ones from the COVID-19 pandemic be similar? <br> **Create**: Compose a twitter thread addressing the similarities/differences between the media/social media coverage of the AIDS epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. </br> |
| Week 13 | The People of Color Who Built this Movement | Read ["The Combahee River Collective Statement"](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/combahee-river-collective-statement-1977/) and “La Güera" by Cherríe Moraga, "The Master's Tools will Never Dismantle the Master's House" by Audre Lorde, and "Revolution: It's Not Neat or Pretty or Quick" by Pat Parker from *This Bridge Called My Back: Writings By Radical Women of Color* | Watch *The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson*; found on Netflix; and [*Kai Shappley: A Trans Girl Growing Up In Texas*]( https://www.them.us/video/watch/kai-shappley-a-trans-girl-growing-up-in-texas) | **Discuss**: Current debates in queer activism including bathroom bills, gay marraige and adoption, and high rates of violence against trans women of color. Consider the intersections of race, gender, class, and socioeconimic status. <br> **Create**: Think about the historical artifacts that we've been working with in class; how might these artifacts compose a collection about queer activism? Begin brainstorming ideas for your creative project. </br> |
| Week 14 | History in the Present | Read ["Old Objects, new media: Historical collections, digitization, and affect"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359183512453534) by Jenny Newell and two current news articles about queer activism.

## 1.5. Points and Evaluation (How This Works)

This class uses a point-based grading system that is seperate from its system for feedback. This is so that you can comfortably experiment with strategies and ideas in a risk-free environment.

What this means is **as long as you complete the basic requirements laid out for each assignment, you will receive the full points possible.** However, I will be providing you detailed qualitative feedback on your analyses and your projects based on the goals that you communicate in your proposals. This feedback, however, will not result in lost points.

Otherwise, points will be used to determine your final grade according to the following:

| Assignment | Point Value |
|-|-|
| Creates (12 total, 2.5 Points Each) | 25 (30 possible) |
| Remix Project | 5 Points |
| Narrative Project | 10 Points |
| Activism Project | 10 Points |
| Final Reflective Portfolio | 50 Points |
| **TOTAL** | **100 Points** |

Note that you are only expected to *complete 10 of the twelve* Creates, though you can complete all of them for extra credit.

**Remix Project (5 points):** The remix project will invite you to take all our musings about hacking, reimagining, and repurposing narratives and structures to make new ones! For this project, you'll become familiar with one of the media toolkits for this course to create: 1) audio remixes (Mashup of songs and sounds, a dubbing, original musical cover, etc.) 2) visual remixes (edited photos, erasures, superimpositions, etc.) 3) video remixes (fancuts, video haikus, mashups, fake trailers, etc.). Your goal for this project is to explore themes you want to express, and get familiar with the digital tools you most want to learn. Your Remix Project should consist of *either*: a small collection of 2-5 smaller works (single image edits, short audio clips, 30 second videos, etc.) or a single, longer work (something involving original art or recording, a longer video or audio remix). There's a lot of freedom here, but you'll be proposing your idea early in the unit, and getting feedback from your peers and me to help shape your explorations.

**Narrative Project (10 points):** You will create either a brief script for a short film, or shoot your own video, that tells an original story with queer characters or themes. This narrative should both be personally impactful to you and should engage with the ideas and issues surrounding queer representation in media that we explored in the unit.  

**Activism Project (10 points):** For this project, I want you to consider all of the artifacts that we've viewed, from the documentary films, to the interactive AIDS quilt, to various art and music tributes to LGBTQ+ activism. This project will have you create an artifact on a activist or movement from queer history. These artifacts do not have to be traditional museum like artifacts; do not let that limit you. You can create social media accounts, websites or blogs, art pieces, interactive media pieces, etc. to inform a viewer about the activist or movement that you've chosen. You can engage with movements outside of the United States as well.

The **Final Reflective Portfolio (25 points)** will include revisions of your other projects, as well as a critical reflection. This reflection can either be theoretical (a theory about Queer Media) or artistic (exploring your own position or growth as a media artist and designer).

There will be opportunities to earn extra points on the unit projects and final portfolio, for work that goes above and beyond. There is unlikely to be extra credit in additional assignments.

### 1.5.1. Grade Distribution

Point totals will be distributed through Canvas. Final point totals will be calculated according to the above table. Each point is a grade-point percentage (so a final score of 98 will mean a grade total of 98%). Additional feedback will be given in the forms of individualized notes and comments. This feedback is for you to build your portfolio and explore your media theory and practice, and will not be held against your numeric grade.

### 1.5.2. Incomplete Grades and Late Work

Late work is accepted as long as it submitted within 1 week of the original deadline, or with instructor approval. Any extensions that have been asked for **24 hours** ahead of the deadline of a project or assignment will be granted. The Final Reflective Portfolio, however, must be submitted on time. Be wary that leaving assignments to run past their deadline can make it harder to stay on course; communicate with me if you are having difficulties meeting the required deadlines.

You will not earn points for assignments that are left unsubmitted at the end of the semester.

## 1.2. Collaboration (We're In this Together)

> As a wise meme once said: I want my groupmates to attend my funeral, so that they can let me down one last time.

This class will involve a significant amount of group-work (and group-play!) as the semester unfolds. You will be sharing your work, ideas, projects, gossip, etc.—and learning to work in a community is a crucial part of the media world. For this class, you and several other students will be grouped into teams. Each of you will have a role in this team, and you’ll often work on assignments, projects, and workshops together.

In the event of any difficulty or breakdowns in communication amongst team members, let me know immediately, and I will assist your group a team meeting. During this meeting and we will write up a Group Contract together that clarifies expectations amongst group members (and specifies consequences). This will be decided by the team members, and then signed into syllabus law. I will then enforce the contract your team has established.

## 1.3. What Can I Make My Projects About? (If you're worried, look here!)

You are encouraged to produce media about anything you want to! There are, however, a few limitations and boundaries I want to establish:

1. I do request that you adhere to the policy on content warnings. (See below.)

2. Please do not, under any circumstances, write about or make references to any other person in this class without their express and documented consent. (That does include me. 😊)

If you are making stuff about other people who are not in this class, but who are (1) real and (2) living, for the sake of this class, you do not need to seek their permission. However, you may choose to anonymize them (different names, initials, etc.), or to fictionalize pertinent identifying details. If you decide to publish the work, however, it is usually appropriate to seek their consent as well. (n.b.: This does not necessarily mean that you are obligated to show those people your work, although depending on the content of your piece, that may also be warranted).

If you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to bring it up in class or reach out to me.

## 1.4. Content Warnings (Respect yourself and others!)

Media projects are inherently personal endeavors. This is an excellent and necessary thing; it also spawns some ethical difficulties unique to the field, many of which will rear their heads during the course of this semester.

We will be reading/viewing things that you may find personally offensive or discomfiting. Sometimes work we are examining for class might make you uncomfortable; sometimes work produced by your classmates might have that same effect. There are some things we’ll be examining that even make me a bit uncomfortable! You are not required to like everything. Far from it. You will learn plenty by hating some of the things in this class. What I ask, however, is that you approach the work respectfully, and with the question of “what can I take away from this? What can I steal and use?”

**Content Warnings on class works**: With that said, every work that I will give or assign you in this class is clearly labelled with content warnings, to specify potentially triggering or disturbing content. You can trust your own feelings about whether or not this will be material you can handle—all I ask is that you be true to yourself, andjust let  me know if you need to excuse yourself from a discussion or activity as a result.

**Content Warnings on your projects:** Some of you may choose to write about things that are difficult, personal, violent, or disturbing. You are allowed to create meida these things! The only rule is that if you are including content that may evoke a potentially traumatic reaction in a viewer (and bear in mind, we cannot know our audience's reactions—we can only guess), that you clearly label this with a content warning at the top of the document or piece.

*Examples of content warnings:*
• Contains extensive profanity, or racial slurs, etc.
• Contains violence, body-horror, sexual assault, physical or verbal abuse, suicide, or other triggering experiences.
• Contains racism, misogyny, ableism, homophobia, etc.
• Contains horror (and remember some people are easily scared), sexual material, or animal cruelty.

Remember, content warnings are not ‘apologies.’ They are a kindness to your audience, whose personal experiences we cannot anticipate. You don’t want to ruin someone’s day by accidentally bringing up a host of traumas; and this is how we avoid that.

## 1.5. Permissions and Privacy (What's Yours is Yours!)

Whether you think about it this way or not, over the course of this semester you will be making art. This art belongs to you—not the school, not me, not anyone else. As a result of this, I will often advise you about the best ways to keep your work as private or publicly-available as you want. With that being said: please be aware that if you put work, which you may decide to publish some day in the future, onto a public website, some journals and publishers will consider that “self-publication.”

Over the course of this class, I will provide you guidance on how to keep your content accessible within the dynamics of our class without making it publicaly visible. If you put your content on any other site, or choose not to use our course login, you will be responsible for managing the privacy of your own work.

*As a result, it is expected that you keep your peers’ work off of any public spaces without consulting them first, and take consideration before publicizing your work digitally*. We will discuss this more as the semester goes on.

Finally, you will have total privacy control over the content you make in this course. You can, at any time, revoke or grant viewership permissions. My only request is that you make the required content visible to me, and your group mates (where required). Otherwise, you don’t have to share anything you don’t want to. After the semester is over (and final grades are posted), you will be welcome to remove the site at your leisure.

**Finally, if you make something that you later decide you are uncomfortable sharing with the class or your peers, just come talk to me—we will work it out.**

## 1.6. Course Policies

### 1.6.1. UCF’s Course Accessibility Statement

The University of Central Florida is committed to providing access and inclusion for all persons with disabilities. This syllabus is available in alternate formats upon request. Students with disabilities who need specific access in this course, such as accommodations, should contact the professor as soon as possible to discuss various access options. Students may also connect with Student Accessibility Services (Ferrell Commons, 7F, Room 185, sas@ucf.edu, phone (407) 823-2371). Through Student Accessibility Services, a Course Accessibility Letter may be created and sent to professors, which informs faculty of potential access and accommodations.

#### 1.6.1.1. My Inclusive Learning Statement

No two people learn exactly the same way. If you find that the materials are difficult for you to absorb, don’t assume right away that you don’t understand the material! Perhaps you prefer to process information through speaking or listening, but all I am providing are written handouts, making it difficult for you to process. If there are aspects of the design, instruction, and/or experiences within this course that result in barriers to your inclusion or accurate assessment of achievement, please notify me as soon as possible.

Disabilities are visible and invisible, documented and undocumented: I do not distinguish between these designations. If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, I encourage you to speak with me as soon as you can about your learning needs and how I can best accommodate them, and/or contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS) [see contact information above].

I do not require documentation for accessibility in my classroom. If you have learning needs from me that I'm not meeting, you can come tell me. You may contact SAS without notifying me if you wish; you may also speak with me without contacting SAS at all.

### 1.5.2. Laptops, Phones, Cyborgs, Technology in the Classroom (The Tech Policy!)

Given that this is a media course, it will often be necessary that we have access to laptops/internet-capable-technology for composing, viewing materials, and working in groups. The use of electronic devices will be permitted generously.

I do request, however that your phone be put on silent and put away unless it is being used for class purposes. Otherwise, I ask that you generally honor the “3 second rule” (you may quickly check your phone, reply to a quick message and such, but then please return it to your pocket/desk/bag). If there is an emergency and you need to use your phone or be “on-call,” just let me know. Use of laptops in class should be focused on classroom materials and at appropriate times.

#### 1.5.2.1. Email

The best way to contact me is through Webcourses messaging. Please allow at least **24 hours** for an email response from me during the week (Monday through Thursday), and at least **48 hours** for an email response over the weekend (Friday-Sunday). It is a policy of the University of Central Florida that all students are required to have and maintain a Knight's email address. All students are required to provide the instructor with their Knight's email address and use this address for all class communication. No other email address will be recognized by the instructor for communications.

#### 1.5.2.2. Open Labs

This course requires lab work utilizing specialized software and equipment. If you find yourself needing additional time to work on your assignments, SVAD has several labs available for students to work outside of class or lab hours. The lab schedule is available and will be distributed and is also on the individual lab room doors.  Open labs are available in the VAB building, OTC 500 bldg and the Student Union.

### 1.5.2. Academic Integrity

Students should familiarize themselves with UCF’s Rules of Conduct at <https://scai.sdes.ucf.edu/student-rules-of-conduct/>. According to Section 1, “Academic Misconduct,” students are prohibited from engaging in

1. Unauthorized assistance: Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information or study aids in any academic exercise unless specifically authorized by the instructor of record. The unauthorized possession of examination or course-related material also constitutes cheating.
2. Communication to another through written, visual, electronic, or oral means: The presentation of material which has not been studied or learned, but rather was obtained through someone else’s efforts and used as part of an examination, course assignment, or project.
3. Commercial Use of Academic Material: Selling of course material to another person, student, and/or uploading course material to a third-party vendor without authorization or without the express written permission of the university and the instructor. Course materials include but are not limited to class notes, Instructor’s PowerPoints, course syllabi, tests, quizzes, labs, instruction sheets, homework, study guides, handouts, etc.
4. Falsifying or misrepresenting the student’s own academic work.
5. Plagiarism: Using or appropriating another’s work without any indication of the source, thereby attempting to convey the impression that such work is the student’s own.
6. Multiple Submissions: Submitting the same academic work for credit more than once without the express written permission of the instructor.
7. Helping another violate academic behavior standards.
8. Soliciting assistance with academic coursework and/or degree requirements.

#### 1.5.2.1. Responses to Academic Dishonesty, Plagiarism, or Cheating

Students should also familiarize themselves with the procedures for academic misconduct in UCF’s student handbook, The Golden Rule <https://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/>. UCF faculty members have a responsibility for students’ education and the value of a UCF degree, and so seek to prevent unethical behavior and respond to academic misconduct when necessary. Penalties for violating rules, policies, and instructions within this course can range from a zero on the exercise to an “F” letter grade in the course. In addition, an Academic Misconduct report could be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which could lead to disciplinary warning, disciplinary probation, or deferred suspension or separation from the University through suspension, dismissal, or expulsion with the addition of a “Z” designation on one’s transcript.

Being found in violation of academic conduct standards could result in a student having to disclose such behavior on a graduate school application, being removed from a leadership position within a student organization, the recipient of scholarships, participation in University activities such as study abroad, internships, etc.

Let’s avoid all of this by demonstrating values of honesty, trust, and integrity. No grade is worth compromising your integrity and moving your moral compass. Stay true to doing the right thing: take the zero, not a shortcut.

### 1.5.2. Statement on Harassment and Discrimination

I will not allow any form of harassment, or discrimination based on race, religion, gender identity, pronouns, sexual orientation, ability, etc. in any course assignments, discussions, or messages. If you or a classmate is experiencing harassment or discrimination in any form from another student or university employee, please reach out to me and I will provide any assistance that I can. For UCF’s policies on harassment and discrimination, see the Let's Be Clear website.

### 1.5.3. Land Acknowledgement

We acknowledge, with respect, that the land we are on today is the traditional and ancestral homelands of the Seminole, Miccosukee, Timucua, and numerous other Native tribes. We also acknowledge the manipulation, coercion, and violence enacted against these nations, including the Treaties of Moultrie Creek, Payne’s Landing, and Pensacola, which now afford us access to the land, water, and air of these Nations’ traditional homelands. We recognize the violent past and dire, ongoing costs to Native Nations and peoples on whose land this university -- now a place of learning and socialization -- was built upon. We recognize the Indigenous peoples as original stewards of this land and all the relatives within it.

We understand that acknolwedgement is not enough and that we, as a course community, as a department, and as an institution, should actively work towards decolonization and the return of Native lands to Native peoples. This acknowledgement acts as a conversation starter, one that needs to be had in this country where so many Native lives have been lost to a inhospitable government and its people, and that only through action, and not just words in fancy statements, will we be able to truly honor the Native people and their land.

### 1.5.4. Course Accessibility Statement

The University of Central Florida is committed to providing access and inclusion for all persons with disabilities. Students with disabilities who need access to course content due to course design limitations should contact the professor as soon as possible. Students should also connect with Student Accessibility Services (SAS) <http://sas.sdes.ucf.edu/> (Ferrell Commons 185, sas@ucf.edu, phone 407-823-2371). For students connected with SAS, a Course Accessibility Letter may be created and sent to professors, which informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Determining reasonable access and accommodations requires consideration of the course design, course learning objectives and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SAS, faculty and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience.

### 1.5.5. Third-Party Software and FERPA

During this course you might have the opportunity to use public online services and/or software applications sometimes called third-party software such as a blog or wiki. While some of these could be required assignments, you need not make any personally identifying information on a public site. Do not post or provide any private information about yourself or your classmates. Where appropriate you may use a pseudonym or nickname. Some written assignments posted publicly may require personal reflection/comments, but the assignments will not require you to disclose any personally identity-sensitive information. If you have any concerns about this, please contact your instructor.

If you are a UCF Online student, please consult the UCF Online Student Guidelines for more information about your access to non-academic services.

### 1.5.6. Campus Safety Statement

Emergencies on campus are rare, but if one should arise during class, everyone needs to work together. Students should be aware of their surroundings and familiar with some basic safety and security concepts.

- In case of an emergency, dial 911 for assistance.
- Every UCF classroom contains an emergency procedure guide posted on a wall near the door. Students should make a note of the guide’s physical location and review the online version at <http://emergency.ucf.edu/emergency_guide.html>.
Students should know the evacuation routes from each of their classrooms and have a plan for finding safety in case of an emergency.
- If there is a medical emergency during class, students may need to access a first-aid kit or AED (Automated External Defibrillator). To learn where those are located, see <https://ehs.ucf.edu/automated-external-defibrillator-aed-locations>.
- To stay informed about emergency situations, students can sign up to receive UCF text alerts by going to <https://my.ucf.edu> and logging in. Click on “Student Self Service” located on the left side of the screen in the toolbar, scroll down to the blue “Personal Information” heading on the Student Center screen, click on “UCF Alert”, fill out the information, including e-mail address, cell phone number, and cell phone provider, click “Apply” to save the changes, and then click “OK.”
